If not availed within the time period of 1 month, the compensatory off shall automatically be lapsed. • For applying compensatory off, employees should have worked for a minimum eight hours on any Off day / holiday. • Accumulation of working hours spent on different days is not permissible. • Individuals can avail compensatory off only based on being pre-sanctioned. • While on compensatory off, weekly off and paid Holidays will be excluded for computation.          Absenteeism and Abscondment:        What is absenteeism?                 Absenteeism is a habitual pattern of absence from work.                   What is abscondment? When a Hasher fails to be present at work – virtually or in-person as expected on 3 or more consecutive days without notifying their manager requesting time off. In virtual ways of working i.e., remote working, an employee is considered as “absent” when He/she/they are not attending meetings, unavailable on email, MS teams, and not responding to communication via phone.             Implications:  •  If a Hasher has not been responsive to his team/HR/Allocation team over teams/emails/phone calls for over 3 or more days from the day of absence, there will be two warning emails sent in the span of 4 days from the date of absence reported.  • If HR is unsuccessful to receive a response from Hasher, it will lead to the termination of the   employment. • Employees remaining absent without intimation will be treated as unscheduled absenteeism. 10 unscheduled absenteeism leads to termination. • Employees remaining absent for 10 consecutive days from the date of expiry of the sanctioned leave period without any intimation, would be treated as ‘absconder’.   3. BONUS    3.1. One-time payments If the employee is paid a joining bonus / relocation allowance / retention bonus / one time award for AWS or any other one-time bonus, it is contingent for one year from the date of payment i.e if the employee resigns before completing 1 year from the date of payment, the joining bonus / relocation allowance / retention bonus / AWS bonus or any other one-time bonus that is paid is to be returned to the company and will be adjusted in the full and final settlement.  3.2. Variable Bonus HashedIn gives the variable bonus in two halves. This is only applicable for the hashers, whose components have Variable Bonus into their Gross Salary. Team announces the bonus by early May for Oct-Mar period, and by early Nov for Apr-Sep cycle. Performance bonus will be considered only if the employee has completed the bonus cycle. If the employee resigns before the completion of the bonus cycle, he/she will not be paid the bonus for that cycle. The payments are usually completed by May / Nov month respectively.   Following are the two attributes used for the same. Both have equal contribution (~50%) in calculating cumulative bonus payout: - • Company Performance - Overall growth and margin of the company • Your contribution to HashedIn values and fun is not just events and parties. It's day to day work e.g. how fun are you to work with for your team. This also involves your contribution towards organization in activities like recruitment, HU, presales, building IP, etc.   3.2.1. Some FAQs  What does a 100% bonus mean? If you got a 100% bonus for the complete half, that means both company performance and your contribution(s) was excellent during the period. 100% bonus payout is equivalent to your 1-month salary OR 50% of total your variable component.  Formula to calculate Total variable component for the cycle = (\"1/4th of Variable component\n",

      "0.52\tthey can be beneficial for both employer and employee. This work from Home policy is applicable to all employees as it enables suitable employees to occasionally work from home for business reasons.  mailto:hashedinrecruitment@deloitte.com  4.1 Conditions governing availment of WFH: • Employees wishing to occasionally work from home must secure the agreement of their reporting manager prior to the actual date of home working. Retrospective requests will not normally be agreed. When approving requests, reporting managers are responsible for ensuring that there is a    clear business requirement for the employee to undertake work from home rather than attending the office. • There should be the tasks list shared with the manager on the plan of the tasks to finish for the day and also there should be an update sent by the end of day. Overall, the manager should have the track of what tasks are completed for the day the employee has applied for WFH. • If the WFH is not pre-approved by the manager and the employee nevertheless continues to do so, the manager has the right to convert it to leave. • There are no half day WFH, productivity of at least 8 hours is mandatory on a working day. Decrease in working hours result in reduction of leave. • The reporting manager will be responsible for monitoring the employee’s productivity while WFH. If the reporting manager feels that enough work is not produced by the eod when the employee is WFH, the manager has the right to convert it to leave. • The reporting manager needs to be confident that sufficient resources are available within the team to cover the employee’s absence from work. The reporting manager can cancel a WFH if he or she feels that the team and business would be adversely impacted because of the employee's absence from office or that the employee doesn't have sufficient resources (internet, electricity, voice call    etc.) to avail WFH. Don’t rely on mobile data for the internet, make sure you have a good WIFI connection.   • When working from home, the employee must be aware of the increased risk of a security breach. The employee must ensure that all documentation is stored securely, and that any laptop or PC is password protected and turned off when not in use.      • IT equipment provided to the employee to support working from home is for the exclusive use of    that employee alone. The employee is not permitted to allow family members or friends to use IT equipment provided to them. • If an employee is unable to work on the day which they had expected to work from home due to sickness, injury or otherwise, the employee is required to keep their manager informed of the likely date of return to work, the reason for the absence, and progress, as if they were normally attending work. • Any abuse of the working from home arrangements amounting to misconduct will be subject to disciplinary action.  4.2 DAY CARE FACILITY         4.2.1 What is it?  For parents with young children, an important aspect of well-being is to ensure that their young ones are taken care of while they are at work. In compliance with the Maternity Benefit Act, 1960, we are committed to helping you secure the best day care option for your children and are glad to offer a flexible Day Care for       Children Program.

      "0.48\tsalary OR 50% of total your variable component.  Formula to calculate Total variable component for the cycle = (\"1/4th of Variable component during the Q1 of the half + 1/4th of Variable component during the Q2 of the half)  Notes: Bonus is adjusted for tenure during the bonus cycle. Bonus amount would be credited after standard tax deduction (TDS).  Does bonus percentage depend on the Half Yearly Performance Rating? If you had the Below rating, then there is no Bonus for that half. Otherwise, there is no dependency of the rating (At Specs / Above Specs) into this payout.  I am a new employee and joined the company in between the half yearly bonus cycle? For the employees entering a bonus cycle for the first time, the bonus pay-outs shall be prorated for the duration worked in the bonus cycle.  I am an intern. Am I eligible for a bonus payout? Bonus payout is only for full-time employees. As an intern, you are not a full-time employee of HashedIn and, therefore, not eligible for a bonus.  I am a new joinee and a part of HU for 6-8 weeks, does that period count in the bonus cycle? No, the HU Training period of new employees is not considered in the Bonus Cycle. Once they graduate from the HU, then only the evaluation period starts  Is this across all the roles? Yes and No. There are few roles in HashedIn that have explicitly defined incentive plans. For that, the calculation is done based on their targets. 3.3. Employee Referral Bonus HashedIn encourages employees to refer their friends, relatives and acquaintances, who in their opinion, would be a right fit to work at HashedIn, as every employee of HashedIn is a brand ambassador. The employee referral program is an opportunity for the employees to earn extra bonus and be able to contribute in creating the best team of qualified and efficient people, working for the success of the company, making “HashedIn” a desirable place to work. This policy is applicable from 1st November 2017.  3.3.1. Referral Bonus   If the referral is selected and hired, referral bonus will be paid based on the band that the referral candidate is hired at.  BAND / LEVEL REFERRAL BONUS (INR) Fresher(B7/B8) INR 10,000/-   Band 7 INR 15,000/- Band 6L & 6H INR 20,000/- Band 5L and above INR 25,000/- This will be given to the employee who has referred once the recruit completes 6 months at HashedIn. In case of freshers, the bonus will be paid after the completion of 6 months of full-time employment. To avail this bonus, the referral has to be an active employee of HashedIn at the time the bonus is supposed to be paid. This referral bonus is a one-time payment.  3.3.1. Procedure Employees can refer whenever the Job opening is announced as per the company’s requirement or if otherwise the employee thinks a candidate would be appropriate to work with the organization. Employees can get the details of the Job availability from the HR team. In order to refer a candidate the employee needs to send the updated resume to hashedinrecruitment@deloitte.com.  3.3.2. Terms & Conditions  Apart from recruitment and the leadership team everyone is eligible to avail the referral bonus.  At the time of payout, the referrer and the referee should be on the payrolls of the company. If either of them has resigned under any circumstances, then the employee would not be eligible for the bonus. Any changes in the scheme will be notified by the HR department.   4.

      "    • Employees shall be entitled to compensatory off at the discretion of their department Head. • Compensatory off will be applicable if employees have worked on Off days / holidays either from home or office to meet the deadlines or some project urgencies. • Compensatory off should be availed within 1 month from the day of working on weekly off. If not availed within the time period of 1 month, the compensatory off shall automatically be lapsed. • For applying compensatory off, employees should have worked for a minimum eight hours on any Off day / holiday. • Accumulation of working hours spent on different days is not permissible. • Individuals can avail compensatory off only based on being pre-sanctioned. • While on compensatory off, weekly off and paid Holidays will be excluded for computation.          Absenteeism and Abscondment:        What is absenteeism?                 Absenteeism is a habitual pattern of absence from work.                   What is abscondment? When a Hasher fails to be present at work – virtually or in-person as expected on 3 or more consecutive days without notifying their manager requesting time off. In virtual ways of working i.e., remote working, an employee is considered as “absent” when He/she/they are not attending meetings, unavailable on email, MS teams, and not responding to communication via phone.             Implications:  •  If a Hasher has not been responsive to his team/HR/Allocation team over teams/emails/phone calls for over 3 or more days from the day of absence, there will be two warning emails sent in the span of 4 days from the date of absence reported.  • If HR is unsuccessful to receive a response from Hasher, it will lead to the termination of the   employment. • Employees remaining absent without intimation will be treated as unscheduled absenteeism. 10 unscheduled absenteeism leads to termination. • Employees remaining absent for 10 consecutive days from the date of expiry of the sanctioned leave period without any intimation, would be treated as ‘absconder’.   3. BONUS    3.1. One-time payments If the employee is paid a joining bonus / relocation allowance / retention bonus / one time award for AWS or any other one-time bonus, it is contingent for one year from the date of payment i.e if the employee resigns before completing 1 year from the date of payment, the joining bonus / relocation allowance / retention bonus / AWS bonus or any other one-time bonus that is paid is to be returned to the company and will be adjusted in the full and final settlement.  3.2. Variable Bonus HashedIn gives the variable bonus in two halves. This is only applicable for the hashers, whose components have Variable Bonus into their Gross Salary. Team announces the bonus by early May for Oct-Mar period, and by early Nov for Apr-Sep cycle. Performance bonus will be considered only if the employee has completed the bonus cycle. If the employee resigns before the completion of the bonus cycle, he/she will not be paid the bonus for that cycle. The payments are usually completed by May / Nov month respectively.   Following are the two attributes used for the same. Both have equal contribution (~50%) in calculating cumulative bonus payout: - • Company Performance - Overall growth and margin of the company • Your contribution to HashedIn values and fun is not just events and parties. It's day to day work e.g. how fun are you to work with for your team. This also involves your contribution towards organization in activities like recruitment, HU, presales, building IP, etc.   3.2.1. Some FAQs  What does a 100% bonus mean? If you got a 100% bonus for the complete half, that means both company performance and your contribution(s) was excellent during the period. 100% bonus payout is equivalent to your 1-month salary OR 50% of total your variable component.
